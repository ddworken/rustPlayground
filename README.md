# rustPlayground

A repository holding a bunch of random rust code for my Independent Study in rust. 

This is for stuff where I am just working on learning the language and the various details of the language. Once I have finished getting a hang of the basics of the language I will transition over to working on a strings alternative. Hopefully I should be comfortable enough with the language to get started on that within a couple of weeks.
