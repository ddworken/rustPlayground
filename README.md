# rustPlayground

A repository holding a bunch of random rust code for my Independent Study in rust. 

This is for stuff where I am just working on learning the language and the various details of the language. Once I have finished getting a hang of the basics of the language I will transition over to working on a strings alternative. Hopefully I should be comfortable enough with the language to get started on that within a couple of weeks. 

In general I plan on doing: 

1. fibonacci
2. hailstone
3. caesar cipher
4. prime number generation
5. car dice
6. hangman

If you have any suggestions on other useful or especially important programs to add to the above list, tell me.
