# Finds all prime numbers between 0 and a number from the user

This program uses the sieve of eratosthenes to find primes between 0 and n. Code is heavily based off of the sieve of eratosthenes I wrote in the Advanced Computer Science course but instead of using an array I had to use a vector. This is because in rust arrays have to have a compile time defined length (vectors do not have this limitation).
